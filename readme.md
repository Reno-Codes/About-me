<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Renato, a passionate Frontend Web Developer based in the beautiful country of Croatia. I'm currently exploring the dynamic world of web development, with a focus on crafting engaging and user-friendly interfaces.

<h3 align="center">What do I do?</h3>

I'm really just more of passionate to being challenged and building something better. I've got my hands into enough places along the way, but I think the good mix of this knowledge adventure and exploration allowed me to keep being hungry for more knowledge, which is actually a good thing (If you ask me ðŸ˜‚).

I'm great problem solver, critical thinker and I would like to gain enough knowledge to be able to solve all the problems that I come across.

<h3 align="center">What can I work in and around?</h3>

Oh boy. This is a really wide list, but really, these are the ones I've sort of gone headfirst into. Some of these, I have personally made projects on for my myself or for my friends.
