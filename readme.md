<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

I was born in Osijek, Croatia, lived mostly in ƒêakovo, until I moved to Osijek. (psst.. between us, it was more the love, wine and cheese stringing me along here) and been here since then. Well we can all agree the pandemic hasn't allowed a further trips than Osijek. üòÇ

<h3 align="center">What do I do?</h3>

I'm really just more of passionate to being challenged and building something better. I've got my hands into enough places along the way, but I think the good mix of this knowledge adventure and exploration allowed me to keep being hungry for more knowledge, which is actually a good thing (If you ask me üòÇ).

I'm great problem solver, critical thinker and I would like to gain enough knowledge to be able to solve all the problems that I come across.

<h3 align="center">What can I work in and around?</h3>

Oh boy. This is a really wide list, but really, these are the ones I've sort of gone headfirst into. Some of these, I have personally made projects on for my myself or for my friends.
